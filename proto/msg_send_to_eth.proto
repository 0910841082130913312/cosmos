// This is the message that a user calls when they want to bridge an asset
// it will later be removed when it is included in a batch and successfully
// submitted tokens are removed from the users balance immediately
// -------------
// AMOUNT:
// the coin to send across the bridge, note the restriction that this is a
// single coin not a set of coins that is normal in other Cosmos messages
// FEE:
// the fee paid for the bridge, distinct from the fee paid to the chain to
// actually send this message in the first place. So a successful send has
// two layers of fees for the user
